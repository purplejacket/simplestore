I- Access via mobile app:
a- mobile app contacts the server and passes the server a query string and a unique (device) identifier. The server logs the unique identifier, and then looks up the query string in its database and returns the found value as a response.
b- mobile app contacts the server and passes the server a query string, a passcode and a unique identifier. The server logs the unique identifier and then looks up the query string in its database. If the database indicates that a passcode is required, then the provided passcode's hash value is checked against a hash value in the database, and if there is a match, then the server will return the found value as a response. Here passcodes can be short, say 6-10 characters, or a phrase.
c- Same as b, but the passcodes are longer so that we can build a set of passcodes, all of which hash to the same value, so we can provide different groups with their own passcodes, and be able to know which group/individual was requesting values. Passcodes are longer here and while it is preferable to make them like a passphrase, easy to enter, they may be 16 character alphanumerics separated by dashes.
